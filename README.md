# Machine Learning Analysis of the Art Institute of Chicago

# Background:

In this project, we employ Machine Learning to analyze the art collections housed at the Art Institute of Chicago. We utilize variables such as the nationality of the artist, view, category title, and type of artwork to analyze the frequency of historical exhibitions of the artworks and delve into the backgrounds of the artists. The primary question addressed in this project is the application of Machine Learning to predict the next artwork likely to be displayed.


# Project Requirements:

#Data Model Implementation: 
The Python script initializes, trains, and evaluates the model, performs data cleansing and normalization, utilizes data retrieved from SQLite, and demonstrates the model's meaningful predictive power with a minimum classification accuracy of 75% or an R-Squared value of 0.85.

# Data Model Optimization:
Changes made during the optimization and evaluation process are documented in a CSV file and displayed at the end of the script.

# GitHub Documentation:
The README contains the contents of the project.

# Group Presentation:
All group members present smoothly within the time restrictions and maintain audience interest.
