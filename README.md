# Machine Learning Analysis of the Art Institute of Chicago

# Background:

In this project, we employ Machine Learning to analyze the art collections housed at the Art Institute of Chicago. We utilize variables such as the nationality of the artist, view, category title, and type of artwork to analyze the frequency of historical exhibitions of the artworks and delve into the backgrounds of the artists. The primary question addressed in this project is the application of Machine Learning to predict the next artwork likely to be displayed.
